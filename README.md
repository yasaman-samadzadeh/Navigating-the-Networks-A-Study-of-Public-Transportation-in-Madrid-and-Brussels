# 🚍 Navigating the Networks: A Study of Public Transportation in Madrid and Brussels

This project analyzes the public transport networks of **Madrid** and **Brussels**, focusing on efficiency, connectivity, and community structure. Using **General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)** data, we apply **network analysis techniques** to uncover key insights into service clusters, high-activity zones, and system resilience.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Centrality Analysis**: Degree, Eigenvector, Betweenness, and Closeness centrality.
- **Community Detection**: K-means clustering, K-Core analysis, and modularity.
- **Spatial Visualization**: Mapping transport networks using `folium`, `geopandas`, and `matplotlib`.
- **Comparative Study**: Evaluating structural differences and vulnerabilities between Madrid and Brussels.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing (`pandas`), network analysis (`NetworkX`), and visualization (`matplotlib`, `folium`).
- **GTFS Data**: Standardized transit datasets from **STIB/MIVB (Brussels)** and **EMT Madrid**.

## 📂 Data Sources
- Publicly available **GTFS** data from [Mobility Database](https://mobilitydatabase.org).
- Official transit agencies:
  - [STIB/MIVB (Brussels)](https://www.stib-mivb.be)
  - [EMT Madrid](https://www.emtmadrid.es)
